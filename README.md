### Shop Billing System in C++ using Classes

This C++ program implements a Shop Billing System using object-oriented programming principles. It provides functionalities for both administrators and customers to manage and process transactions within a simulated supermarket environment.

#### Features:

1. **Administrator Functions:**
   - **Login/Registration:** Administrators can log in using existing credentials or register with a valid employee ID.
   - **Product Management:**
     - **Add Product:** Allows adding new products to the system with details such as code, name, price, and discount.
     - **Modify Product:** Enables modifying existing product details based on the product code.
     - **Delete Product:** Allows deleting products from the inventory using the product code.
     - **Display Products:** Displays a list of all available products with their details.
     - **Search Product:** Facilitates searching for a specific product by its code.

2. **Customer Functions:**
   - **Product Purchase:** Customers can select products from the displayed menu, enter quantities, and generate a receipt showing the total amount due after applying discounts.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - **File Handling:** Uses file operations to store and retrieve product information, ensuring persistence across sessions.
   - **User Interface:** The program utilizes console-based menus for interaction, providing a straightforward user experience.
   - **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for duplicate product codes and ensures data integrity during file operations.

#### Usage:

- Upon running the program, users are presented with a main menu where they can choose between administrator and customer modes.
- Administrators can manage products (add, modify, delete, display, search) and access product menus.
- Customers can select products to purchase and generate receipts showing detailed transactions.
- The program ensures security with login functionality for administrators and registers new administrators with employee IDs.

#### Notes:

This project serves as a practical application of C++ programming concepts, focusing on classes, file handling, and user interface design within the context of a supermarket billing system. It is suitable for educational purposes and can be expanded or modified based on specific business requirements.
